The following 2 files need to be present in this directory when using the default implementations for SourceAccountProvider and TargetAccountProvider.

- source.xml
- target.xml

The source.xml file should contain the provider account information you received. This is the information that was sent to you upon account creation.

The target.xml file in subversion should not be changed unless you are substituting a new platform queue.

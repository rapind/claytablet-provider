The following 2 files need to be present in this directory when using the default implementations for SourceAccountProvider and TargetAccountProvider.

- source.xml
- target.xml

The source.xml file should contain the provider account information you received.

The target.xml file in subversion should not be changed unless you are substituting a new platform queue.

Clay Tablet Provider Client
---------------------------

The Clay Tablet Technologies provider client project is a starting point for Java based provider implementations.

The project includes an event receiver that will receive events from the Clay Tablet platform and an event sender that will send events to the Clay Tablet platform. Methods for uploading and downloading asset, support asset, and asset task version files to and from remote storage are included.

There is also an event listener cron provided which will poll the provider queue every X interval.

In order to properly run the tests and use the client code provided you will need to request a clay tablet account. Please send account requests to drapin@clay-tablet.com and include your name and your company name, and that you require a provider account. Once your account has been created you will be sent an xml file which should be placed in /src/main/resources/accounts/.

The classes of interest for third-party integrators are:
- /src/main/java/com/claytablet/app/ProviderEventCron.java
- /src/main/java/com/claytablet/service/event/impl/ProviderEventListenerImpl.java
- /src/main/java/com/claytablet/service/event/impl/ProviderReceiverImpl.java
- /src/main/java/com/claytablet/service/event/impl/ProviderSenderImpl.java

You can run the event reception cron from ant with the "event" task. I.e. "ant event". You will begin listening to the queue specified in your account XML.

We recommend using Java 1.5 for this project due to issues with Java 6 and JAXB versions. At least until Java 6 Update 5 is released. For more details see:
